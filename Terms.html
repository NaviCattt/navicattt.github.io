            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>
                The time it takes to finish your commission is between <span class="highlight">1 day - 7 days</span> once its your turn on the queue depending on factors such as the complexity of the commissioned piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there are any unexpected issues that delay the initially planned delivery time, I'll let you know as soon as possible.
            </p>
             <p>
                If I make a mistake in the order (e.g., misinterpret reference, miss a mark), the responsibility is entirely mine and I will fix it at no cost.
             </p>
             <p>
                Should any alterations be deemed excessive or major, there is a possibility that additional charges may be incurred.
